# Network Security - Wireless Security Practice Code

This repository contains Python code for practical wireless security exercises. Each functionality is accompanied by a brief description and usage instructions.

## Code Specifications
- Programming Language: Python
- Testing Environment: Kali Linux, IPtime(N150UA2)
- Prerequisites: Wireless LAN card must support monitor mode.

## Functionalities

### 1) airodump

This Python version replicates the airodump command, used for collecting wireless Wi-Fi information.

### 2) Beacon Flooding Attack

To connect to Wi-Fi routers, routers periodically receive Beacon Frames from Access Points (AP).

By receiving forged Beacon Frames, one can create a fake Wi-Fi network while simultaneously disrupting other APs from connecting to Wi-Fi normally.

### 3) Deauthentication Attack

When attempting to connect to Wi-Fi, after the connection is accepted, the communication proceeds.

This attack method intercepts deauthentication communication, forcing arbitrary APs to disconnect.

### 4) Signal Strength Check

This code helps to check the wireless signal strength of surrounding Wi-Fi networks.
